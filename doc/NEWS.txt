============
* vfontas: add new N2 vectorizer
* vfontas: new -saven2 command to use N2

The N2 vectorizer is able to recognize logical 45-degree angles in
bitmap glyphs and will output the outlines as such. Unlike N1,
it analyzes glyph outlines rather than pixel patterns, and produces
higher quality output due to a larger working radius.

N2 can reproduce the "Nouveau IBM" font quite closely now (e.g. from
Fontraption's VGA9.F16 file). A few differences have just become apparent (one
can inspect in e.g. Inkscape by overlaying both fontfaces) that may be
addressed in a later release.

N2:
* Serifs are subject to diagonalization (but maybe should become exempt).
* Isthmuses tend to get washed out, noticable in glyphs like 'G'.
* Sumps in the 'K', 'M', 'N' glyphs could be improved.
  This is noticable in glyphs like 'G'.

Nouveau IBM:
* Kerning is not original: too closely spaced.
* Node points are not at pixel or half-pixel locations.
  'B' has a 30.78 diagonal for no apparent reason. This is bad for integral
  scaling. Other values can be observed in 'W'.
* Glyph 'C' is asymmetric.
